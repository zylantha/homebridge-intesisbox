# homebridge-intesisbox

Supports Mitsubishi Heavy and (probably) many other air conditioners connected via an Intesisbox WiFi interface on HomeBridge Platform

# What is an Intesisbox?

The Intesisbox is one of many different air conditioning interfaces made by Intesis.  They are all very similarly named, and this can be confusing.

Do not confuse the Intesisbox with the Intesishome or any of the other similarly named products - they are functionally different and incompatible!

The Intesisbox provides a WiFi and TCP-controlled interface to air conditioners, connecting directly into the wired remote control interface on the unit.  While there are other versions that talk to the IR interface on 
these air conditioners, I don't have one so don't know how they differ.  The Intesisbox is intended to talk directly to a home automation system, but the vendor only provides drivers for high-end commercial systems.  
This module provides a Homebridge compatible interface to control the air conditioner through the Intesisbox.
